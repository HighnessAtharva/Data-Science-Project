# Python Data Science Project

In this project, we will design Python Application for Data Analysis
Creating a Data Analysis Application, all at once may seem a herculean task, and hence this project is divided into six modules.

## DAY 1

### Today we start with the first module – Read CSV File and store data in the dictionary

The goal of today's task is to get the following output:-

It may look scary, but it's not that difficult. The screen consists of following

    - Read CSV File and store data in the dictionary.
    - Each key in the dictionary should be a string, as read from the CSV file. The value of that key will be a Python list. 
    - You will use this dictionary for the next three modules.
At this stage, your goal is to simply read file. The challenge is you can’t use any python library like pandas.

## DAY 2

### It's time to start the data analysis. The simple assignment today is to 

    - Take input from the user 
    - Calculate worldwide statistics (min, max, average) for a user-entered year

The goal of today's task is to get the following output:-

## DAY 3

### Plot the emissions data from a user-selected country

It's time to visualize the data. Plot the emissions data from a user-selected country. You should use Python plotting library matplotlib for drawing the plots. The below should be your output.
